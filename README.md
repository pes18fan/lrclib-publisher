# lrclib-publisher

This is a little Python program to publish custom lyrics to LRCLib.

## how to use it?

Put in your plain and synced lyrics in files named `lyrics.txt` and `lyrics_synced.txt`.
Next, simply run `publisher.py`. It'll solve the proof-of-work challenge required
to publish on LRCLib, then ask you for the details of your track apart from the
lyrics, which it'll read from the previously mentioned files.

Following that, your track will be published.
